            <h2 style="margin-left: 165px;"> Agile vs. waterfall project management</h2>
            <p>
            Early adopters of agile development were often small, self-contained teams working on small, self-contained projects. They proved the agile model can work, to the joy and betterment of software makers around the world. It turned out the waterfall development model wasn't as effective for the development of software as agile project management was for most teams               
            The popularity of agile project management has led to more organizations scaling agile beyond single teams or projects and applying it to whole programs. Agile has even spread beyond development teams to include IT, marketing, business development, and more.

            <h2 style="margin-left: 165px;">What is agile project management?</h2>
            <p>
            Agile project management is an iterative approach to delivering a project, which focuses on continuous releases that incorporate customer feedback. The ability to adjust during each iteration promotes velocity and adaptability. This approach is different from a linear, waterfall project management approach, which follows a set path with limited deviation.               
            With today’s customers and businesses requiring rapid responses and changes, agile provides the flexibility to adjust and iterate during the development process. Agile project management is also a cornerstone of DevOps practices, where development and operations teams work collaboratively.

            <h2 style="margin-left: 165px;">What is waterfall project management? </h2>
            <p>
                The waterfall project management approach entails a clearly defined sequence of execution with project phases that do not advance until a phase receives final approval. Once a phase is completed, it can be difficult and costly to revisit a previous stage. Agile teams may follow a similar sequence yet do so in smaller increments with regular feedback loops. 
                The waterfall project management approach follows a linear, sequential formula. It works well for work that has predictable, recurring processes, yet it can leave development teams flat-footed and unable to adjust faster than a competitor.                
                A single missed deadline or scope change during a waterfall project can cause outsized impacts on subsequent releases. Additionally, when a team is fully focused on the next phase of work, resolving technical debt or fixing bugs can be painful if the team is fully allocated to new feature work and always pressing forward to the next stage.
                this is an illustration of a standard waterfall project:

                <br><br>The waterfall model can exacerbate some of the known challenges of building products:
                
                <br><br>>Blockers and dependency management: Traditional project management styles often create "critical paths", where the project can't move forward until a blocking issue is resolved.
                <br><br>>Difficulty getting user feedback and product validation: To add insult to injury, the end customer can't interact with the product until it's fully complete. Thus, important issues in the product design and code go undiscovered until release.

            <h2 style="margin-left: 265px;"> Agile vs. waterfall  </h2>
            <p>
            Agile was first adopted by software teams, who moved from the traditional, sequential waterfall approach to a method that garnered consistent feedback and adjustment throughout the development lifecycle.
            Agile project management takes an iterative approach to development by creating several incremental steps with regular feedback intervals. This
            promotes adaptability since a team can adjust throughout the product development process, rather than being confined to a linear path. It also allows for regular, high-impact releases that enable teams to deliver a series of wins over time.

        <section id="section9">
            <h2 style="margin-left: 288px;">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Agile project management is an innovative approach not only for 
                software projects but for projects of all stripes. By providing the 
                flexibility to respond to change during the development lifecycle, agile allows teams to 
                ship higher quality products that meet customers’ needs. Agile empowers teams, builds accountability,
                 and encourages innovation while promoting continuous improvement. Agile gives you the ability to respond 
                 to change without going off the rails. And that’s great for any program,but it's not without its challenges,
                Agile, like any methodology, has its drawbacks and challenges that organizations need to address, such as potential difficulties in scaling Agile to larger projects, managing remote teams, or maintaining documentation.
