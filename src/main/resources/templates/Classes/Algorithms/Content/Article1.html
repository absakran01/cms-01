        <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is an Algorithm?</h2>
        <p>
            An algorithm is a set of commands that must be followed for a computer to perform calculations or other problem-solving operations. According to its formal definition, an algorithm is a finite set of instructions carried out in a specific order to perform a particular task. It is not the entire program or code; it is simple logic to a problem represented as an informal description in the form of a flowchart or pseudocode.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">How do Algorithms Work?</h2>
        <p>
            Algorithms are step-by-step procedures designed to solve specific problems and perform tasks efficiently in the realm of computer science and mathematics. These powerful sets of instructions form the backbone of modern technology and govern everything from web searches to artificial intelligence. Here's how algorithms work:

            <br>
            <br>
            - Divide and Conquer Algorithm: Breaks a complex problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and then combines their solutions to address the original problem effectively.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Greedy Algorithm: Makes locally optimal choices at each step in the hope of finding a global optimum, useful for optimization problems but may not always lead to the best solution.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Dynamic Programming Algorithm: Stores and reuses intermediate results to avoid redundant computations, enhancing the efficiency of solving complex problems.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Randomized Algorithm: Utilizes randomness in its steps to achieve a solution, often used in situations where an approximate or probabilistic answer suffices.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">How to Write an Algorithm?</h2>
        <p>
            There are no well-defined standards for writing algorithms. It is, however, a problem that is resource-dependent. Algorithms are never written with a specific programming language in mind.<br>
            As you all know, basic code constructs such as loops like do, for, while, all programming languages share flow control such as if-else, and so on. An algorithm can be written using these common constructs.<br>
            Algorithms are typically written in a step-by-step fashion, but this is not always the case. Algorithm writing is a process that occurs after the problem domain has been well-defined. That is, you must be aware of the problem domain for which you are developing a solution.

    <section id="section8">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Complexity of an Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
            The algorithm's performance can be measured in two ways:<br>
            - Time Complexity<br>
            - Space Complexity

        <h3>Time Complexity</h3>
        <p>The amount of time required to complete an algorithm&#x27;s execution is called <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/data-structure-tutorial/time-and-space-complexity" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="time complexity.">time complexity.</a> The big O notation is used to represent an algorithm&#x27;s time complexity. The asymptotic notation for describing time complexity, in this case, is big O notation. The time complexity is calculated primarily by counting the number of steps required to complete the execution. Let us look at an example of time complexity.</p>
        <table><tbody><tr>
            <td>
                <p>mul = 1;</p>
                <p>// Suppose you have to calculate the multiplication of n numbers.  </p>
                <p>for i=1 to n  </p>
                <p>mul = mul *1;  </p>
                <p>// when the loop ends, then mul holds the multiplication of the n numbers  </p>
                <p>return mul;  </p>
            </td>
        </tr></tbody></table>
        <p>The time complexity of the loop statement in the preceding code is at least n, and as the value of n escalates, so does the time complexity. While the code&#x27;s complexity, i.e., returns mul, will be constant because its value is not dependent on the importance of n and will provide the result in a single step. The worst-time complexity is generally considered because it is the maximum time required for any given input size.</p>
        <h3>Space Complexity</h3>
        <p>The amount of space an algorithm requires to solve a problem and produce an output is called its space complexity. Space complexity, like time complexity, is expressed in big O notation.</p>
        <p>The space is required for an algorithm for the following reasons:</p>
        <ol>
            <li aria-level="1">To store program instructions.</li>
            <li aria-level="1">To store track of constant values.</li>
            <li aria-level="1">To store track of variable values.</li>
            <li aria-level="1">To store track of function calls, jumping statements, and so on.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Space Complexity = Auxiliary Space + Input Size</p>
        <p>Finally after understanding what is an algorithm, its analysis and approches, you will look at different types of algorithms.</p>
